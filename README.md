The name of my brand is called Howling Pixels! If you want to work together and/or what to connect with me, hover the card to see my information on the back. I'm howling for something amazing!

This mini project was made using plain html and css. I used a flip animation so when the user hovers over the card, it flips the card to the back.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would like to make the card more responsive.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to flip a card using css.
